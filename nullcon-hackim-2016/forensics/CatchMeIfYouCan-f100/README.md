There are lot of writeups to this challenge , but lets go throw to the main mession here..
extracting the highly compressed file :
at first a tried to extract it manually but it's really so hard it will take a long time.
so i found some bash scripts to extract but it was corrupted.
i decided to do this script for automatic extract the file and to get the main folders.
